## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Which inverters are supported?</b></summary>

**A:** The card works with any inverter that provides sensors in Home Assistant. Successfully tested with:
- Fronius (Symo, Gen24)
- SolarEdge
- Huawei (Sun2000)
- SMA (Sunny Boy, Tripower)
- Kostal (Plenticore, PIKO)
- Goodwe
- Solis
- Victron (Venus OS)
- And many more...

The card uses standard Home Assistant sensors, so any integration that provides power sensors will work.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Do I need a battery?</b></summary>

**A:** No, the battery is optional. The card works perfectly with just PV, house, and grid sensors. Battery features (SoC display, charge/discharge tracking, runtime calculations) are only active when battery sensors are configured.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Can I use multiple PV systems?</b></summary>

**A:** Yes! Use the PV Bar feature to track up to 5 individual PV systems:

```yaml
pv_bar:
  show: true
  entities:
    - entity: sensor.pv_south_power
      name: 'South Roof'
    - entity: sensor.pv_east_power
      name: 'East Roof'
```

See [PV Configuration](pv-config.md#multiple-pv-systems-pv-bar) for details.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Can I track multiple batteries?</b></summary>

**A:** Yes! Use the Battery Bar feature to monitor up to 5 batteries:

```yaml
battery_bar:
  show: true
  entities:
    - entity: sensor.battery1_soc
      name: 'Main Battery'
      capacity: 10000
    - entity: sensor.battery2_soc
      name: 'Backup Battery'
      capacity: 5000
```

See [Battery Configuration](battery-config.md#multiple-batteries-battery-bar) for details.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: How many consumers can I add?</b></summary>

**A:** Unlimited! The card supports as many consumers as you want. Use sorting and thresholds to keep the display manageable:

```yaml
consumers:
  show: true
  sort_mode: highest_first
  threshold: 10
  items:
    # Add as many as you need
```
</details>

### Configuration Questions

<details>
<summary><b>Q: What does the grid power sign mean?</b></summary>

**A:** Grid power follows this convention:
- **Positive (+)** ‚Üí Importing from grid (consuming)
- **Negative (-)** ‚Üí Exporting to grid (feed-in)

If your sensor is reversed, create a template sensor:

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Grid Power Corrected"
        unit_of_measurement: 'W'
        state: "{{ states('sensor.grid_power') | float * -1 }}"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Why is my autonomy showing over 100%?</b></summary>

**A:** This happens during strong feed-in. The calculation is:
```
Autonomy = (House - Grid) / House √ó 100%
```

When exporting (negative grid), the numerator becomes larger than denominator, resulting in >100%. The card automatically limits display to 100%.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Why doesn't battery runtime show?</b></summary>

**A:** Battery runtime requires:
1. `battery_capacity` configured in root config
2. Battery SoC sensor (0-100%)
3. Battery discharge sensor (W) with value > 0
4. `calculate_battery_times: true` in info_bar

Check all requirements are met.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: How do I change the language?</b></summary>

**A:** The card automatically detects Home Assistant's language. To override:

```yaml
language: de    # de | en | fr | it | es
```

Supported: German, English, French, Italian, Spanish
</details>

### Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Card not showing after installation</b></summary>

**A:** Try these steps:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Verify resource is added (Settings ‚Üí Dashboards ‚Üí Resources)
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Check that card type is `custom:pv-monitor-card`
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Animations not working</b></summary>

**A:** Check:
1. `animation: true` is set on the card
2. `pv_max_power` or `battery_capacity` is configured (required for animations)
3. Entity values are > 0
4. Browser supports CSS animations
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Consumer sum doesn't match house consumption</b></summary>

**A:** This is normal! The consumer sum only includes tracked devices above threshold. Untracked loads (lighting, always-on devices, etc.) explain the difference:

```
House: 3450 W          ‚Üê Total consumption
Consumers: 2100 W      ‚Üê Tracked devices
Untracked: 1350 W      ‚Üê Lighting, base load, etc.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Threshold not working</b></summary>

**A:** Check:
1. Threshold is configured (`threshold: 10` for grid/consumers)
2. Value is appropriate for your system (try increasing)
3. Entity provides numeric values
4. Units are in Watts (not kW)
</details>

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Sensor Configuration

**‚úÖ Use Watts (W) for all power sensors**
```yaml
# Good
entities:
  pv_production: sensor.pv_power          # Returns: 5000 W

# Avoid
entities:
  pv_production: sensor.pv_power_kw       # Returns: 5 kW
```

**‚úÖ Battery SoC should be 0-100 (not 0-1)**
```yaml
# Good
battery_soc: sensor.battery_soc           # Returns: 75 (%)

# Bad
battery_soc: sensor.battery_soc_decimal   # Returns: 0.75
```

**‚úÖ Grid power sign convention**
```yaml
# Correct convention:
# +1000 W = Importing from grid
# -1000 W = Exporting to grid
entities:
  grid_power: sensor.grid_power
```

### Performance Optimization

**Limit Consumer Count**
```yaml
consumers:
  threshold: 10                   # Hide low-power devices
  sort_mode: highest_first        # Show important ones first
```

**Use Template Sensors for Complex Calculations**
```yaml
# Instead of frequent recalculation, create template sensor:
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Total PV Power"
        state: >
          {{ states('sensor.pv1_power')|float + states('sensor.pv2_power')|float }}
```

### Visual Clarity

**Start with a Theme**
```yaml
theme: modern-dark              # Use pre-built theme as base
```

**Use Consistent Colors**
```yaml
# Pick a color scheme and stick to it
pv:
  style:
    primary_color: '#FFD700'    # Gold for PV
    icon_color: '#FFD700'

batterie:
  style:
    primary_color: '#4CAF50'    # Green for battery
```

**Test Readability**
- Check in both day and night lighting
- Ensure sufficient contrast
- Test on mobile devices

```

### Customize Card Order

```yaml
layout_order:
  - header
  - info_bar
  - pv_bar
  - cards
  - battery_bar
  - consumers
```

### Create Custom Threshold Sensor

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: "High House Consumption"
        state: >
          {{ states('sensor.house_power')|float > 3000 }}

# Use in automation
automation:
  - alias: "Alert High Consumption"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.high_house_consumption
        to: 'on'
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "House consumption above 3kW!"
```

## üìä Understanding Calculations

### Autonomy (Self-Sufficiency)

```
Autonomy = (House Consumption - Grid Import) / House Consumption √ó 100%
```

**What it means:**  
Percentage of your consumption covered by own generation (PV + Battery)

**Example:**
- House: 3000 W
- Grid Import: 500 W
- **Autonomy: 83.3%**

You're covering 83.3% of consumption from PV + Battery.

### Self-Consumption (Self-Use)

```
Self-Consumption = (PV Production - Grid Export) / PV Production √ó 100%
```

**What it means:**  
Percentage of PV production you use directly (not exported)

**Example:**
- PV: 5000 W
- Grid Export: 1000 W
- **Self-Consumption: 80%**

You're using 80% of PV production directly.

### Battery Runtime

```
Runtime = (Battery SoC √ó Capacity) / Discharge Power
```

**What it means:**  
Estimated time battery can power house at current rate

**Example:**
- SoC: 80%
- Capacity: 10 kWh
- Discharge: 2000 W
- **Runtime: 4 hours**

### Battery Charge Time

```
Charge Time = ((100 - Battery SoC) √ó Capacity) / Charge Power
```

**What it means:**  
Estimated time to full charge at current rate

**Example:**
- SoC: 40%
- Capacity: 10 kWh
- Charge: 3000 W
- **Charge Time: 2 hours**
